While many cats live exclusively indoors, a significant portion are allowed to roam outside, where their natural hunting instincts are let loose. This has implications not only for the health and enrichment of the cats themselves, but also for the local ecosystems. Studies have suggested that free-ranging cats can have substantial impacts on bird and small mammal populations, raising concerns among conservationists. On the other hand, understanding these behaviors also helps cat owners make more informed decisions about enrichment, diet, and overall animal welfare.\n\nThe dataset analyzed in this project, the *Pet Cats United States Reference Data*, contains records of individual cats across the USA. Each entry documents both demographic details and behavioral notes. The relevant variables include:\n\n- **animal-id**: A unique identifier treating each cat as an individual observation.  \n- **animal-sex**: Categorical string indicating whether the cat is male or female.  \n- **animal-life-stage**: String stored as free-text (e.g., \"2 years old\") then cleaned into numerical ages and further categorized into four life stages (kitten, adult, mature, senior).\n- **animal-comments**: A free-text column containing structured phrases about if the cat hunts and how many pray it catches per month in the format *“Hunt: Yes; prey_p_month: 12”*.  \n- **hunts**: A Boolean variable derived from parsing `animal-comments` that indicates whether the cat engages in hunting.  \n- **prey_p_month**: A derived numeric variable from parsing `animal-comments` that represents the number of prey caught monthly by that cat.  \n\nThe guiding question I dived into:  \n**“How do life stage and sex affect the behavior and activity of pet cats in the USA, particularly their hunting behavior and prey capture rates?”**\n\nThis question was chosen because it combines demographic and behavioral variables in a way that gives us insights into both practical (for cat owners) and ecological (for conservationists) implications.  \n\nThe chosen data mining approach centers on **data cleaning, transformation, and descriptive analysis through visualization**. This approach was chosen because the dataset is observational, not experimental, and the goal is to summarize and interpret rather than predict. Exploratory mining techniques are the most appropriate for revealing structure in demographic and behavioral data of this kind.\n\n---\n\n# Data Preparation and Cleaning\n\nThe raw dataset contained several challenges that needed careful handling before meaningful analysis could be performed. Data cleaning was a critical step because the quality of downstream analysis depended heavily on properly parsed input. \n\n**Age Cleaning and Categorization**  \nThe `animal-life-stage` column originally included text-based descriptions such as “3 years” or “1 year old.” These were standardized by extracting numeric values, converting them to integers, and removing blanks. Once cleaned, cats were categorized into life stages:  \n- **Kitten (0–2 years)** – Young and still developing hunting skills.  \n- **Adult (2–6 years)** – Typically the prime age for activity and hunting.  \n- **Mature (6–10 years)** – Beginning to show declines but still capable hunters.  \n- **Senior (10+ years)** – Often less active due to age-related changes.  \n\nThis binning was pulled from common veterinary classifications and allows behavioral trends to be compared across meaningful age groups.  \n\n**Parsing Owner Comments**  \nThe `animal-comments` field contained structured phrases, such as *“Hunt: Yes; prey_p_month: 12”*. These were split into two explicit variables:  \n- `hunts`: Encoded as True if hunting was reported, False if explicitly stated otherwise, and blank if missing.  \n- `prey_p_month`: Converted into numeric form, making quantitative comparisons possible.  \n\nThis transformation illustrates how even semi-structured text can be mined for structured variables, a common need in real-world data projects.  \n\n**Handling Missing Data**  \nNot all records contained complete information. For example, some had blank life stages or comments. Rather than discarding all incomplete cases, missing ages were excluded from age-based analysis, while missing hunting data was treated as “unknown” unless clearly marked. This approach balances data retention with analytic clarity.  \n\nThe final cleaned dataset was structured containing numeric and categorical variables ready for descriptive data mining.\n\n---\n\n# Mining Methods and Approach\n\nThe approach relied on to answer the research question was **descriptive and exploratory data mining methods**.\n\n1. **Descriptive Statistics**  \nBasic summaries (counts, averages, percentages) were used to understand overall hunting prevalence and prey capture rates.  \n\n2. **Grouping and Aggregation**  \nCats were grouped by both life stage and sex, allowing hunting prevalence and prey rates to be compared across demographic subgroups.  \n\n3. **Visualization**  \nCharts were created to summarize insights, including bar charts for categorical comparisons and boxplots for prey count distributions. Visual exploration allowed for identifying patterns and outliers in a way that might not be possible from the tables alone or uncleaned.\n\n---\n\n# Results\n\n### Hunting Prevalence\nHunting behavior varied across both life stage and sex. Male cats were more likely to be hunters than females, consistent with prior research on territorial and genetic tendencies. Adults had the highest likelihood of hunting, while Seniors were much less active.  \n\n### Prey Capture Rates\nAmong cats that hunted, prey capture rates varied. Adult and mature cats averaged the highest number of prey per month, while Senior cats maintained the lowest levels. This most likely is due to reduced activity and physical agility.  \n\n### Age-Related Behavior\nBreaking the data into life stages revealed a clear behavioral trajectory:  \n- **Kittens:** Moderate hunting activity, likely due to inexperience.  \n- **Adults:** Peak hunting period, aligning with peak physical condition.  \n- **Mature:** Still active but beginning to decline.  \n- **Seniors:** Minimal hunting.  \n\nThese results suggest that the age or life stage of a cat has a stronger influence than sex, though sex still has a significant impact.  \n\n---\n\n# Discussion\n\nThe findings reinforce both biological expectations and practical concerns. Cats in their adult years, especially males, are the most active hunters. This finding is important for cat owners who are considering outdoor access, as well as for ecologists who are assessing impacts on wildlife.  \n\nFrom a **pet ownership perspective**, owners of young adult cats might want to consider supervised outdoor play or indoor enrichment alternatives to reduce pressure on local ecosystems. For older cats, owners may want to consider to adapt enrichment to keep them stimulated given reduced hunting.  \n\nFrom a **conservation perspective**, these findings align with broader concerns about free-ranging cats. While not all cats hunt, those that do, especially adult and mature male cats, can contribute significantly to wildlife predation. Understanding which cats are most likely to hunt allows for more targeted education.  \n\nThis study also highlights the value of **data cleaning and transformation in data mining**. The original dataset did not provide ready-made variables for analysis. By engineering `hunts` and `prey_p_month` from comments, we unlocked insights that would otherwise remain hidden.\n\nThere are a few limitations of this dataset. One limitation is that the dataset is owner-reported and may under or overestimate actual behavior. Another limitation is the absence of linkage between animal demographic information and geographic data collected by the trackers.\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis project highlights how data cleaning, transformation, and descriptive mining can reveal patterns in behavioral data. By focusing on life stage and sex of cats, we can show that hunting behavior is larger in male and adult cats, while female and senior cats contribute little in comparison.\n\nFuture research could expand the dataset, add geographic or longitudinal dimensions, or apply predictive models. The dashboard currently provides a clear summary of cat behavior to be utilized by pet owners and ecologists.\n\n",
