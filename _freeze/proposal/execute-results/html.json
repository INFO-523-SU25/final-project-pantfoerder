This dataset contains GPS tracking data for pet cats in the United States and includes variables such as timestamps, animals IDs, sex, age, location coordinates, and movement attributes. The main dataset \"pet-cats-usa.csv\" has 659770 rows and 15 columns. The reference dataset \"pet-cats-usa-reference-data.csv\" has 154 rows and 21 columns. This datasets is ideal for spatial and temporal analysis and its size is well suited for data mining and interactive data visualization. I chose this dataset because it allows for movement pattern detection as well as outlier detections which is ideal for discovering interesting behavioral insights into the ecological impact of pet cats in the United States.\n\n## Questions\n\n1.  What movememnt patterns do pet cats in the United States exhibit?\n\n2.  Can we identify potential outliers or unusual behaviors in cat movement data?\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   For Question 1 I can:\n    -   Visualize cat movement paths on a map using `location-lat`, `location-long`, and `timestamp`.\n    -   Group movement patterns by `animal-sex` and `animal-life-stage`.\n    -   Summarize key statistics such as average daily travel distance\n-   For Question 2 I can:\n    -   Identify outliers using `ground-speed`, `algorithm-marked-outlier`, and `manually-marked-outlier`.\n    -   Highlight unusual behaviors\n    -   Create filters for users to view specific subsets of cats\n\n## Timeline\n\n-   Week 5: Perform basic exploratory analysis and explore static visualizations that could be used for the dashboard.\n-   Week 6: Develop dashboard components with outliers and filtering features.\n-   Week 7: Finalize dasbhoard and submit project write-up.\n\n## Project Organization\n\n```         \nfinal-project-nessapantfoerder/\n│\n├── data/\n│   ├── pet-cats-usa.csv\n│   ├── pet-cats-usa-reference-data.csv\n│   └── README.md           # Description of the data files\n│\n├── _extra/\n│   └── analysis.ipynb      # Initial exploratory analysis\n│   └── README.md           # Purpose of the folder\n│\n├── images/                 # Any images needed for the presentation or website\n│\n├── about.qmd               \n├── index.qmd               \n├── presentation.qmd        \n├── proposal.qmd            \n├── _quarto.yml             \n├── README.md            \n└── requirements.txt       \n```\n\n",
